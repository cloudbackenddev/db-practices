## 3. Detailed Entity Requirements

### Entity 1: [Entity Name]

**Business Purpose:**
```
[Describe what this entity represents in business terms]
```

**Sample Data Structure:**
```
Choose ONE approach based on your data structure:

OPTION A: Normalized Structure (Most Common)
Provide sample data as key-value pairs for structured fields:
- id: 12345
- public_id: "01HN2K8G7QRXM9VWPZ3F4T5Y6B"
- username: "john_doe"
- email: "john.doe@example.com"
- first_name: "John"
- last_name: "Doe"
- date_of_birth: "1990-05-15"
- phone_number: "+1-555-123-4567"
- account_status: "ACTIVE"
- registration_date: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
- last_login_date: "2025-01-21T14:22:00Z"

OPTION B: Hybrid Structure (When some fields are variable/flexible)
Provide JSON only for truly variable data:
```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "publicId": "01HN2K8G7QRXM9VWPZ3F4T5Y6B",
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "accountStatus": "ACTIVE",
  "preferences": {
    "newsletter": true,
    "theme": "dark",
    "language": "en"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "web_registration",
    "campaign": "summer_2024"
  }
}
```

**Data Storage Strategy:**
```
Use JSON Storage ONLY when:
- Data structure varies significantly between records
- You have truly flexible/dynamic attributes
- Configuration or preference data with unknown fields
- Metadata that doesn't need to be queried frequently

Use Normalized Tables when:
- Data structure is consistent across records
- Fields are frequently queried or filtered
- You need referential integrity
- Data is used in JOINs or complex queries

Example: User preferences and metadata are good JSON candidates,
but core user fields (name, email, status) should be normalized columns.
```

**Business Rules:**
```
- Username must be unique across the system
- Email must be unique and validated
- Phone number is optional but must be valid format if provided
- Account status can be: ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, DELETED
- Registration date cannot be modified
- Address is optional during registration
```

**Enumerated Values:**
```
- accountStatus: [ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING_DELETION, INACTIVE]
- registrationSource: [WEB, MOBILE, API, ADMIN]
- preferredTheme: [LIGHT, DARK, AUTO]
- notificationPreference: [ALL, IMPORTANT_ONLY, NONE]
```

**Data Volume & Growth:**
```
- Initial: 10,000 records
- Growth: 1,000 new records per month
- Retention: Keep all data (soft delete)
```

---

### Entity 2: [Entity Name]

**Business Purpose:**
```
[Describe what this entity represents in business terms]
```

**Sample JSON Data:**
```json
{
  "id": 67890,
  "publicId": "01HN2K9H8SRYN0WXQZ4G5U6V7C",
  "sku": "LAPTOP-DELL-XPS13-001",
  "name": "Dell XPS 13 Laptop",
  "description": "High-performance ultrabook with 13-inch display",
  "category": {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Electronics",
    "subcategory": "Laptops"
  },
  "pricing": {
    "basePrice": 1299.99,
    "salePrice": 1199.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "taxRate": 0.08,
    "priceHistory": [
      {"price": 1299.99, "effectiveDate": "2024-06-01T00:00:00Z"},
      {"price": 1199.99, "effectiveDate": "2024-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
    ]
  },
  "inventory": {
    "stockQuantity": 25,
    "reservedQuantity": 3,
    "minStockLevel": 5,
    "maxStockLevel": 100,
    "locations": [
      {"warehouse": "NYC", "quantity": 15},
      {"warehouse": "LA", "quantity": 10}
    ]
  },
  "specifications": {
    "processor": "Intel i7-1165G7",
    "memory": "16GB RAM",
    "storage": "512GB SSD",
    "display": "13.3-inch FHD",
    "weight": "2.8 lbs",
    "dimensions": {
      "length": 11.6,
      "width": 7.8,
      "height": 0.58,
      "unit": "inches"
    }
  },
  "attributes": {
    "color": "Silver",
    "warranty": "1 year",
    "energyRating": "A+",
    "certifications": ["FCC", "CE", "RoHS"]
  },
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "createdDate": "2024-06-01T09:00:00Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-20T16:45:00Z",
  "images": [
    "https://cdn.example.com/products/67890/main.jpg",
    "https://cdn.example.com/products/67890/side.jpg"
  ]
}
```

**JSON Storage Strategy:**
```
Complex JSON Fields to Store:
- specifications: Product technical details (varies by category)
- attributes: Dynamic product attributes (color, size, etc.)
- pricing.priceHistory: Historical pricing data
- inventory.locations: Multi-warehouse inventory tracking

PostgreSQL Implementation:
- Use JSONB for specifications and attributes
- Create GIN indexes: CREATE INDEX idx_product_specs ON products USING GIN (specifications);
- Query example: WHERE specifications @> '{"processor": "Intel i7-1165G7"}'

Oracle Implementation:
- Use JSON datatype or CLOB with JSON constraints
- Create function-based indexes on commonly queried JSON paths
- Query example: WHERE JSON_VALUE(specifications, '$.processor') = 'Intel i7-1165G7'
```

**JSON Sample Guidelines:**
```
Provide 2-3 representative samples per entity:
1. Minimal data sample (required fields only)
2. Complete data sample (all fields populated)
3. Edge case sample (maximum complexity, special scenarios)

Example for User entity:
- Minimal: Basic user with required fields only
- Complete: Full profile with preferences, address, metadata
- Edge case: Admin user with special permissions, multiple addresses
```

**Business Rules:**
```
- SKU must be unique across all products
- Base price must be positive
- Sale price cannot exceed base price
- Stock quantity cannot be negative
- Reserved quantity cannot exceed stock quantity
- Product status can be: ACTIVE, DISCONTINUED, OUT_OF_STOCK
```

**Data Volume & Growth:**
```
- Initial: 50,000 products
- Growth: 500 new products per month
- Updates: 1,000 price/inventory updates per day
```

---

### Entity 3: [Entity Name]

**Business Purpose:**
```
[Continue with additional entities following the same pattern]
```

**Sample JSON Data:**
```json
{
  // Add sample JSON for this entity
}
```

**Business Rules:**
```
[List specific business rules for this entity]
```

---

## 4. Relationships and Constraints

### Primary Relationships
```
[Describe key relationships with cardinality, e.g.:]

User (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (Many) Orders
- One user can have multiple orders
- Each order belongs to exactly one user
- Cascade delete: If user is deleted, archive their orders

Product (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (Many) OrderItems  
- One product can appear in multiple order items
- Each order item references exactly one product
- Restrict delete: Cannot delete product if it has order items

Order (1) ‚Üê‚Üí (Many) OrderItems
- One order contains multiple order items
- Each order item belongs to exactly one order
- Cascade delete: If order is deleted, delete all order items
```

### Entity Relationships Diagram *(OPTIONAL - Visual representation)*
```
[Provide a simple visual diagram using Mermaid syntax for quick comprehension:]

erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ ORDERS : places
    ORDERS ||--|{ ORDER_ITEMS : contains
    PRODUCTS ||--|{ ORDER_ITEMS : includes
    CATEGORIES ||--o{ PRODUCTS : categorizes
    USERS ||--o{ USER_PROFILES : has
    USERS }|--|| USER_ROLES : assigned

Alternative text format:
USERS (1) ‚Üí (Many) ORDERS ‚Üí (Many) ORDER_ITEMS ‚Üê (Many) PRODUCTS
CATEGORIES (1) ‚Üí (Many) PRODUCTS
USERS (1) ‚Üí (1) USER_PROFILES
```

### Business Constraints
```
[List important business constraints, e.g.:]

Data Integrity:
- Order total must equal sum of order item totals
- Stock quantity must be updated when orders are placed
- Payment amount must match order total

Business Logic:
- Users cannot place orders if account is suspended
- Products cannot be ordered if out of stock
- Orders cannot be modified after payment is processed

Temporal Constraints:
- Order date cannot be in the future
- Delivery date must be after order date
- Return period is 30 days from delivery
```

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements
```
[Specify performance needs, e.g.:]

Query Performance:
- User login: < 200ms response time
- Product search: < 500ms for 10,000 results
- Order placement: < 1 second end-to-end
- Report generation: < 30 seconds for monthly reports

Concurrency:
- Support 1,000 concurrent users
- Handle 100 orders per minute during peak
- Support 50 concurrent admin users

Data Volume:
- 1M users, 100K products, 10M orders expected in year 1
- 100GB database size expected
- 1TB of file storage for images/documents
```

### Security Requirements
```
[Specify database-level security needs, e.g.:]

Data Protection:
- PII data must be encrypted at rest (affects column design)
- Sensitive fields need special handling (separate tables, encryption)
- Audit trail required for all data changes (audit columns needed)
- Soft delete for user accounts (is_deleted, deleted_at columns)

Compliance Requirements:
- GDPR compliance: Right to be forgotten (soft delete strategy)
- Data retention policy: 7 years for financial records (affects delete strategy)
- PCI DSS: No payment card data stored directly (tokenization approach)

Database-Level Security:
- Row-level security requirements (tenant isolation)
- Column-level encryption needs
- Audit logging requirements (who changed what when)
```

## 6. Data Patterns and Standards

### Naming Conventions
```
Tables: snake_case, singular (user, order, product)
Columns: snake_case (first_name, created_at, is_active)
Primary Keys: id (bigserial)
Foreign Keys: {table}_id (user_id, product_id)
Booleans: is_{condition} (is_active, is_deleted)
Timestamps: {action}_at (created_at, updated_at)

JPA Considerations (if Spring Boot JPA specified):
- Table/column names should map cleanly to Java entities
- Avoid reserved keywords that conflict with JPA
- Foreign key naming should support JPA relationship mapping
- Junction tables: {entity1}_{entity2} (user_roles, order_items)
```

### Public ID Generation Strategy
```
Public ID Generation: Application-generated (recommended)

Rationale:
- Application controls ID generation for batch operations
- Better performance for bulk inserts
- Supports distributed systems without coordination
- Enables offline-first applications
- TSID/UUID generation is more efficient in application code

Implementation:
- Generate TSID/UUID in application before database insert
- Database stores the generated ID (no triggers or functions needed)
- Application handles ID uniqueness and collision detection
```

### Enumerated Types *(RECOMMENDED - For status and category fields)*
```
Define possible values for enum-like fields from your JSON samples:

Example Enums:
- account_status: [ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING_DELETION, INACTIVE]
- order_status: [PENDING, PAID, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, REFUNDED]
- user_role: [ADMIN, MANAGER, USER, GUEST]
- product_status: [ACTIVE, DISCONTINUED, OUT_OF_STOCK, COMING_SOON]
- payment_method: [CREDIT_CARD, DEBIT_CARD, PAYPAL, BANK_TRANSFER]

Benefits:
- Creates DBML Enum types for better schema documentation
- Enables database-level validation
- Improves API documentation and client code generation
- Prevents invalid status values
```

### Standard Fields

#### **PostgreSQL Standard Fields:**
```
Business Entity Tables:
- id: BIGINT DEFAULT nextval('table_name_id_seq') PRIMARY KEY
- public_id: VARCHAR(26) NOT NULL UNIQUE (for TSID)
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- created_by: BIGINT REFERENCES users(id)
- updated_by: BIGINT REFERENCES users(id)
- version: INTEGER DEFAULT 1 (optimistic locking)

Reference/Lookup Tables:
- id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
- name: VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
- is_active: BOOLEAN DEFAULT true

Soft Delete Pattern:
- is_deleted: BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
- deleted_at: TIMESTAMPTZ (nullable)
- deleted_by: BIGINT REFERENCES users(id) (nullable)

JSON Fields:
- metadata: JSONB (flexible attributes)
- preferences: JSONB (user preferences)
```

#### **Oracle Standard Fields:**
```
Business Entity Tables:
- id: NUMBER(19) DEFAULT table_name_seq.nextval PRIMARY KEY
- public_id: VARCHAR2(26) NOT NULL UNIQUE (for TSID)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP
- created_by: NUMBER(19) REFERENCES users(id)
- updated_by: NUMBER(19) REFERENCES users(id)
- version: NUMBER(10) DEFAULT 1 (optimistic locking)

Reference/Lookup Tables:
- id: NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY
- name: VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL
- is_active: NUMBER(1) DEFAULT 1 CHECK (is_active IN (0,1))

Soft Delete Pattern:
- is_deleted: NUMBER(1) DEFAULT 0 CHECK (is_deleted IN (0,1))
- deleted_at: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (nullable)
- deleted_by: NUMBER(19) REFERENCES users(id) (nullable)

JSON Fields:
- metadata: JSON (flexible attributes)
- preferences: JSON (user preferences)
```

#### **ID Generation Strategy:**
```
Business Entity Tables (users, orders, products):
- Internal ID: BIGINT with sequence (for joins/foreign keys)
- Public ID: TSID or UUID (for APIs/external use)
- PostgreSQL: id BIGINT DEFAULT nextval('table_name_id_seq')
- Oracle: id NUMBER(19) DEFAULT table_name_seq.nextval

Reference/Lookup Tables (countries, roles, statuses):
- Simple auto-increment acceptable
- PostgreSQL: id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
- Oracle: id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY

TSID vs UUID:
- TSID: 01HN2K8G7QRXM9VWPZ3F4T5Y6B (26 chars, time-ordered, preferred)
- UUID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 (36 chars, random)

Required Indexes:
- Always index public_id columns
- Use B-tree indexes for TSID/UUID lookups
```

### JSON vs Normalized Decision Matrix

**Use JSON Storage For:**
- Variable attributes that differ by category/type
- User preferences and settings
- Metadata and flexible properties
- Product specifications that vary by category
- Configuration data with unknown structure
- Audit trail details and change logs

**Use Normalized Tables For:**
- Relationships between entities
- Frequently queried and filtered fields
- Structured data with fixed schema
- Data requiring referential integrity
- Fields used in JOINs and complex queries
- Data requiring strong consistency

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended):**
- Store frequently queried fields as columns
- Store flexible/variable data as JSON
- Example: `name VARCHAR(255), category_id BIGINT, specifications JSONB`

### Data Types Preferences

#### **PostgreSQL Specific:**
```
Strings: varchar with appropriate limits (avoid text unless needed)
Numbers: decimal for money, integer for counts, bigint for IDs
Dates: timestamp with timezone (timestamptz) for all datetime fields
Booleans: boolean with meaningful names (is_active, not active)
JSON: jsonb (better performance and indexing than json)
UUIDs: uuid type with proper indexing (consider TSID for better performance)
Arrays: Use PostgreSQL arrays sparingly, prefer junction tables for relationships
Sequences: Use bigserial or custom sequences for auto-incrementing IDs
```

#### **Oracle Specific:**
```
Strings: VARCHAR2 with appropriate limits (avoid CLOB unless needed)
Numbers: NUMBER for money/decimals, INTEGER for counts, NUMBER(19) for IDs
Dates: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE for all datetime fields
Booleans: NUMBER(1) CHECK (value IN (0,1)) or VARCHAR2(1) CHECK (value IN ('Y','N'))
JSON: JSON datatype (Oracle 21c+) or CLOB with JSON constraints (older versions)
UUIDs: RAW(16) for storage efficiency, or VARCHAR2(36) for readability
Sequences: Use Oracle SEQUENCE objects for auto-incrementing IDs
LOBs: Use BLOB for binary data, CLOB for large text
```

#### **Cross-Database ID Strategy:**
```
Primary Keys:
- PostgreSQL: Use bigserial or TSID (Time Series ID) for better performance
- Oracle: Use NUMBER(19) with SEQUENCE for auto-increment

External/Public IDs:
- Both: Use TSID or UUID with proper indexing
- TSID advantages: Time-ordered, shorter, better performance
- UUID advantages: Globally unique, standard format

Index-Friendly UUID/TSID:
- Store as binary format when possible (RAW(16) in Oracle, uuid in PostgreSQL)
- Create dedicated indexes on UUID/TSID columns
- Consider TSID for better clustering and performance
```

## 7. Data Access Patterns and Index Tuning

### **Primary Data Access Paths** *(RECOMMENDED - Critical for performance)*

**Define how data will be accessed to optimize indexing strategy:**

#### **Entity 1: [Entity Name] Access Patterns**
```
Primary Access Patterns:
1. Lookup by public_id (API calls): WHERE public_id = ?
   - Frequency: High (1000+ queries/minute)
   - Index: B-tree on public_id (unique)

2. User authentication: WHERE email = ? AND is_deleted = false
   - Frequency: High (500+ queries/minute)
   - Index: B-tree on email, partial index on is_deleted = false

3. Search by name with filters: WHERE name ILIKE ? AND category_id = ? AND is_active = true
   - Frequency: Medium (100+ queries/minute)
   - Index: Composite index on (category_id, is_active, name)

4. Time-based queries: WHERE created_at BETWEEN ? AND ? ORDER BY created_at DESC
   - Frequency: Medium (reporting queries)
   - Index: B-tree on created_at

5. JSON attribute filtering: WHERE preferences->>'theme' = 'dark'
   - Frequency: Low (admin queries)
   - Index: GIN on preferences (PostgreSQL) or function-based (Oracle)

Range Queries:
- Date ranges: created_at, updated_at
- Numeric ranges: price, quantity, age
- Status filtering: is_active, status, is_deleted

Sorting Requirements:
- Default sort: created_at DESC
- Secondary sort: name ASC, updated_at DESC
- Pagination: LIMIT/OFFSET or cursor-based
```

#### **Entity 2: [Entity Name] Access Patterns**
```
Primary Access Patterns:
1. [Define access pattern]
   - Frequency: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Index: [Specific index recommendation]

2. [Define access pattern]
   - Frequency: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Index: [Specific index recommendation]

Join Patterns:
- Most common joins: [entity1] JOIN [entity2] ON [condition]
- Join frequency: [High/Medium/Low]
- Foreign key indexes: Required on all FK columns

Aggregation Queries:
- COUNT queries: GROUP BY [columns]
- SUM/AVG queries: GROUP BY [columns]
- Reporting queries: Complex aggregations with date ranges
```

### **Cross-Entity Access Patterns**
```
Common Join Patterns:
1. User ‚Üí Orders ‚Üí Order Items (user order history)
   - Frequency: High
   - Indexes: users(public_id), orders(user_id, created_at), order_items(order_id)

2. Product ‚Üí Category ‚Üí Inventory (product catalog with stock)
   - Frequency: High
   - Indexes: products(category_id, is_active), inventory(product_id)

3. Order ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí User (payment processing)
   - Frequency: Medium
   - Indexes: orders(id), payments(order_id), users(id)

Reporting Access Patterns:
1. Daily sales: Orders grouped by date with totals
   - Query: SELECT DATE(created_at), COUNT(*), SUM(total) FROM orders GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
   - Index: orders(created_at, status) where status = 'COMPLETED'

2. Top products: Products with highest sales volume
   - Query: Complex join between products, order_items, orders
   - Index: Composite indexes on join columns and aggregation fields

3. User activity: User login patterns and behavior
   - Query: User sessions with date ranges and activity metrics
   - Index: user_sessions(user_id, created_at, is_active)
```

### **Index Priority Guide**
```
CRITICAL (Must have - create first):
- Primary keys (automatic)
- Foreign keys (all FK columns)
- Unique constraints (business rules)
- Public ID lookups (API access)

HIGH (Performance essential):
- Frequently filtered columns (WHERE clauses)
- Authentication fields (email, username)
- Status/active flags with partial indexes
- Time-based queries (created_at, updated_at)

MEDIUM (Performance beneficial):
- Sorting columns (ORDER BY clauses)
- Join columns beyond foreign keys
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Range query columns (price, quantity)

LOW (Nice to have):
- JSON paths (specific use cases only)
- Text search columns (full-text search)
- Reporting-only queries
- Admin/infrequent operations
```

### **Performance Requirements by Access Pattern**
```
High-Frequency Queries (>100 queries/minute):
- Response time: <50ms
- Must have dedicated indexes (CRITICAL + HIGH priority)
- Consider read replicas for scaling

Medium-Frequency Queries (10-100 queries/minute):
- Response time: <200ms
- Shared indexes acceptable (MEDIUM priority)
- Monitor for optimization opportunities

Low-Frequency Queries (<10 queries/minute):

## 8. Sample Queries and Use Cases

### Critical Query Patterns

#### **PostgreSQL Specific Queries:**
```sql
-- User authentication with JSON preferences
SELECT id, username, password_hash, is_active, preferences
FROM users 
WHERE email = ? AND is_deleted = false;

-- Product search with JSONB specifications
SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name,
       p.specifications->>'processor' as processor,
       p.specifications->>'memory' as memory
FROM products p 
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id 
WHERE p.name ILIKE ? 
  AND p.specifications @> '{"processor": "Intel i7"}' 
  AND p.is_active = true 
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- JSON aggregation for order summary
SELECT o.*, 
       jsonb_agg(
         jsonb_build_object(
           'product_name', p.name,
           'quantity', oi.quantity,
           'price', oi.unit_price
         )
       ) as items
FROM orders o 
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.user_id = ? 
GROUP BY o.id 
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC;

-- TSID/UUID lookup (index-friendly)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE public_id = ?;
```

#### **Oracle Specific Queries:**
```sql
-- User authentication with JSON preferences
SELECT id, username, password_hash, is_active, preferences
FROM users 
WHERE email = ? AND is_deleted = 0;

-- Product search with JSON specifications
SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name,
       JSON_VALUE(p.specifications, '$.processor') as processor,
       JSON_VALUE(p.specifications, '$.memory') as memory
FROM products p 
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id 
WHERE UPPER(p.name) LIKE UPPER(?) 
  AND JSON_VALUE(p.specifications, '$.processor') LIKE '%Intel i7%'
  AND p.is_active = 1
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC 
FETCH FIRST 20 ROWS ONLY;

-- JSON aggregation using JSON_ARRAYAGG
SELECT o.*, 
       JSON_ARRAYAGG(
         JSON_OBJECT(
           'product_name' VALUE p.name,
           'quantity' VALUE oi.quantity,
           'price' VALUE oi.unit_price
         )
       ) as items
FROM orders o 
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.user_id = ? 
GROUP BY o.id, o.order_number, o.created_at
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC;

-- RAW UUID lookup (index-friendly)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE public_id = HEXTORAW(?);
```

#### **Cross-Database JSON Query Patterns:**
```sql
-- Specify which JSON fields need to be queryable:

User Preferences Queries:
- Filter by theme preference
- Filter by notification settings
- Filter by language preference

Product Specification Queries:
- Search by processor type
- Filter by memory size
- Search by specific attributes

Inventory Location Queries:
- Find products in specific warehouse
- Calculate total stock across locations
- Find low-stock items by location

Required JSON Indexes:
PostgreSQL: GIN indexes on JSONB columns
Oracle: Function-based indexes on JSON_VALUE expressions
```

### Reporting Requirements
```sql
-- Example reports that need to be generated

-- Daily sales report
SELECT DATE(o.created_at) as sale_date,
       COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
       SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM orders o 
WHERE o.status = 'COMPLETED'
  AND o.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(o.created_at)
ORDER BY sale_date DESC;

-- Top selling products
SELECT p.name, p.sku, 
       COUNT(oi.id) as times_ordered,
       SUM(oi.quantity) as total_quantity_sold
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
WHERE o.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
  AND o.status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.sku
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 8. Migration and Deployment *(OPTIONAL - Only for existing system migrations)*

### Data Migration Requirements
```
[Complete this section ONLY if migrating from an existing system:]

Source System: [Describe current system]
Data Volume: [Amount of data to migrate]
Migration Strategy: [Big bang vs phased approach]
Data Mapping: [How old data maps to new schema]
Validation Rules: [How to verify migration success]
Rollback Plan: [How to rollback if migration fails]
```



---

## 9. Success Metrics and Validation *(OPTIONAL - For complex enterprise projects)*

### Acceptance Criteria
```
[Complete this section for enterprise projects with strict validation requirements:]

Schema Validation:
- All entities from requirements are represented
- All relationships are properly defined
- All business rules are enforced through constraints
- Naming conventions are followed consistently

Performance Validation:
- All critical queries have appropriate indexes
- Query execution plans meet performance requirements
- Database can handle expected concurrent load

Security Validation:
- Sensitive data is properly classified
- Access controls are defined
- Audit trails are implemented
- Compliance requirements are met
```

---

## 10. Schema Validation and Testing *(RECOMMENDED - Quality assurance)*

### **Schema Validation Queries**
```
Provide queries to validate the generated schema works correctly:

Constraint Validation:
- Check all business rules are enforced
- Verify foreign key relationships work
- Test unique constraints prevent duplicates
- Validate check constraints reject invalid data

Data Integrity Tests:
- INSERT valid data samples
- INSERT invalid data (should fail)
- UPDATE operations with business rule validation
- DELETE operations with cascade/restrict behavior

Performance Testing:
- Execute high-frequency queries with EXPLAIN PLAN
- Test query response times with sample data
- Verify indexes are being used correctly
- Check for missing indexes on slow queries

JSON Schema Validation (if applicable):
- Validate JSON structure matches expected format
- Test JSON queries and indexing
- Verify JSON constraints work correctly
```

### **Sample Validation Scenarios**
```
Business Rule Testing:
1. Try to create user with duplicate email (should fail)
2. Try to create order with invalid status (should fail)
3. Try to delete user with existing orders (should fail/cascade based on design)
4. Try to set negative inventory quantity (should fail)

Performance Testing:
1. Query user by public_id (should use index, <50ms)
2. Search products by category (should use index, <200ms)
3. Generate daily sales report (should complete <30s)
4. Bulk insert 1000 records (should complete <10s)

JSON Testing (if applicable):
1. Query products by JSON specification (should use GIN/function-based index)
2. Update JSON preferences (should maintain structure)
3. Search within JSON arrays (should perform adequately)
```

---

## 11. JPA/ORM Considerations *(RECOMMENDED - If using Spring Boot JPA)*

### **JPA Entity Mapping Requirements**
```
If application framework is Spring Boot JPA, ensure:

Entity Design:
- Single primary key per table (avoid composite keys)
- Surrogate keys (id) for all business entities
- Public IDs as separate columns for API exposure
- Clean mapping to Java entity classes

Relationship Design:
- Foreign keys named for JPA @JoinColumn mapping
- Junction tables for @ManyToMany relationships
- Proper cascade delete/update for JPA cascade types
- Bidirectional relationship support

JSON Field Mapping:
- PostgreSQL JSONB ‚Üí @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON) in JPA 3.1+
- Oracle JSON ‚Üí Custom @Converter implementation
- JSON structure should map to Java POJOs

Query Optimization:
- Indexes optimized for JPQL and Criteria API queries
- Foreign key indexes to prevent N+1 query problems
- Composite indexes for common JPA query patterns
```

### **JPA Performance Patterns**
```
Lazy Loading Support:
- All foreign keys must be indexed
- Avoid deep object graphs without proper indexing
- Consider fetch strategies in relationship design

Batch Operations:
- Design for JPA batch insert/update operations
- Sequence allocation size considerations
- Bulk operation query patterns

Common JPA Query Patterns:
- findBy{Property} methods need single-column indexes
- findBy{Property1}And{Property2} need composite indexes
- @Query with JOIN operations need proper foreign key indexes
```
